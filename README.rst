Software is concrete scientific methodology

Open source software is reproducible scientific methodology

Who are the most important scientists in this area, connecting observational data to physics?

Software development credit:
* Git contribution = number of days where commits where made.
* Impact = number of citations to paper

* List of software repositories from astronomy 
  * (currently) from some conda tree with a few astronomy packages.
    * from there, obtain github URL
  * (future) grep arxiv paper for http urls to github / bitbucket repositories
    * fetch them, find "install" or "start" page with "pip install" or "-m pip install" or "conda install" or "mamba install" command

* Citation for paper
  * ideally from github repo citation standard CITATION.cff
  * paper linked in the start page (arxiv or ads)
  * otherwise, first paper that gives the URL?
    * prefer papers from the author with full name in the repo with most contributions

* People behind the software
  * from github repository
  * connect to authors!
    * match names if possible, give preference to papers citing the original paper

Treemap proportional to git contributions for some conda tree with a few astronomy packages.
